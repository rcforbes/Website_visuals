# Website_visuals

For my personal website (rachelcforbes.com), I created plots to use as a personal logo and header image. These plots reflect weather data from December 2-6, 2020 in Collingwood, ON (just for funâ€” these were the dates and location of my wedding holiday).

The logo is a circular barchat of the temperature for the 24h duration of December 4th, 2020, with each bar indicating the hourly temperature. The bar at 14:00 in light blue indicates the time of my wedding ceremony.

The header image reflects daily (x-axis) and hourly (individual lines) wind speeds (km/h; y-axis).

As these plots are meant for visual purposes only, they are very uninterpretable on their own.
